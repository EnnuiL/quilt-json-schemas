# QuiltMC Mod Metadata (quilt.mod.json)

This subfolder contains all JSON schemas for the quilt.mod.json file.

It is recommended to use the [main JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QuiltMC/quilt-json-schemas/main/quilt.mod.json/schemas/main.json) since it's guaranteed to be future-proof.

The QuiltMC Mod Metadata v1 JSON Schema is based on the [quilt.mod.json specification](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/specification/0002-quilt.mod.json.md).
